#Computer Engineering Program Proposal

##Description
This document attempts a critique, review, and proposal of changes for the Computer Engineering Program at GVSU.

The document was originally written in GitHub flavored Markdown, but has since been converted to LaTeX. The [Markdown version](./Proposal.md) is not updated. The [LaTeX version](./LaTeX/Proposal.tex) is the updated and maintained version of the document.

The [end result](./Proposal.pdf) is the LaTeX version compiled with `pdflatex`.

##Notes
The [Notes.md](./Notes.md) file is used to jot down notes or changes that will be incorporated into the LaTeX document.

##People
The [People.md](./People.md) file is used as a list of the faculty members who should eventually receive a copy of this document for review.

##Build
A build script has been included to run the `pdflatex` build and move the PDF to the root directory:

```bash
./build
Running pdflatex...
Build complete
