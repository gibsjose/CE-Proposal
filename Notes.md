#Proposal Notes

##Description
This document is a place to write down any notes regarding changes or additions to the proposal including content changes/additions and grammatical errors.

```

And check off a completed item with a ~~strikethrough~~:
```markdown

##Notes
* Administrative rules regarding the way professors release content: Using PDFs rather than Word Documents, across the board
* Briefly mention Markdown as a tool for GitHub READMEs
* Link to Professor who recommends GitHub/Git for students: [http://blog.humphd.org/vocamus-1358/?p=1358](http://blog.humphd.org/vocamus-1358/?p=1358)
* Teach OOP design patterns (singleton, etc.) in OOP course

##Completed
* ~~Development boards are useful as showcases for students during interviews~~
* ~~Mention KiCad coming out with an official stable release soon~~
* ~~Mention other version control systems (but mention the benefits specifically of git: open source, distributed, easy to learn, tons of documentation, popularity of GitHub)~~
* ~~Mention GitLab and BitBucket as free private repos (reduce plagiarism)~~
* ~~Logically arrange the components necessary for the ATmega328P board and verify their correctness~~
