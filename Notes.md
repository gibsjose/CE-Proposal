#Proposal Notes

* Administrative rules regarding the way professors release content: Using PDFs rather than Word Documents across the board
* Mention other version control systems (but mention the benefits specifically of git: open source, distributed, easy to learn, tons of documentation, popularity of GitHub)
* Mention GitLab and BitBucket as free private repos
