#Proposal Notes

**GitHub Idea**: An education-focused site like GitHub


1. Administrative rules regarding the way professors release content: Using PDFs rather than Word Documents across the board
2. Mention other version control systems (but mention the benefits specifically of git: open source, distributed, easy to learn, tons of documentation, popularity of GitHub)
3. Mention GitLab and BitBucket as free private repos
